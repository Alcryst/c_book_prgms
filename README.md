# "The C Programming Language" Programs

Don't expect too much from this repository at the moment, I mostly used it to learn how to set up GitHub.

I may put stuff here at some point though.

Book this is based on is (the classic) "The C Programming Language: Second Edition" by Kernighan & Ritchie in case you wanna follow along.
